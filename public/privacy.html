<p>Your personal information is used to personalize your experience, improve the blog to better serve you, efficiently process your requests, tailor advertisements to you, provide you offers, promotions and to follow up with you through correspondence (email). We may also use this information to provide you offers and promotions from our partners and/or our affiliates in exchange for a commission without additional cost to you.</p>
<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Just like other websites, this blog automatically collects certain information about you through Log Data and Google Analytics. Log Data is information about your computer’s Internet Protocol Address, which is your “IP” address, browser information, Internet Service Provider’s information, your operating system, and your browser type. Similarly, Google Analytics collects certain information about your location, browsing history, the pages you visit, the equipment you used to access the website, traffic patterns, and other general patterns related to your use of the blog. </p>

<h3>Comments &amp; Social Media</h3>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. When you leave a comment, your name, email address and website/organization name is not shared with a third party and may be used to communicate with you.</p>
<p>Social media accounts and sharing options are available on this blog. Social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, and others) can track your personal information. Should you choose to interact with us on social media, please note that you will be voluntarily disclosing that personal information. This information is no longer private. It becomes public information and can be collected and used by others. We have no control over and take no responsibility for the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information by you.</p>
<p>Any such interactions via comments and social media with us do not subject us to any kind of liability related to misuse of your information by others.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>The blog may use cookies to facilitate your use of the blog. Cookies are files with small amounts of data including an anonymous unique identifier that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive when you are viewing the blog. Just like other websites, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable information including but not limited to your IP address, geographic location, language preference, date and time of visitors.</p>
<p>Some features of our blog may use Flash cookies, which are small files stored on your computer by websites that use Adobe Flash Player. They can store data such as preferences, settings and usage information like which pages you visit. The main difference between traditional cookies and flash cookies is that they are not managed through the browser but locally on your computer.</p>
<p>When you leave a comment on our blog, you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. </p>
<p>If you have an account and you log in to this blog, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
<p>We may use cookies for various reasons such as optimizing and personalizing your browsing experience, checking our blog analytics, saving your preferences and settings for future use, serving ads based on your liking and interests, affiliate marketing and posting comments on our blog. </p>

<h3>Web Beacons/Pixels</h3>
<p>In conjunction with the use of cookies, third parties may also use web beacons, which are also known as clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags to collect general information about your use of our blog. They monitor user activity and are used to track customer behavior data. This information may be relevant to third parties such as the ad networks used on our blog to tailor the advertising based on your behavior and interests.</p>
<p>We may use social media pixels to track and collect general information about your use in compliance with different social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and others) for the purpose of promoting products, tracking conversions, remarketing, running target advertisements and so forth. </p>
<p>Third parties like Facebook may use their own cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect and receive information from our website for the purpose of providing target advertisements. You may see our ads on Facebook or YouTube after you have visited our blog.</p>
<h3>Third Party Links/Use</h3>
<p>We may include, offer or advertise third party links, products or services on the blog. Once you click on a third-party link and leave this blog, you are no longer bound by our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Articles on this blog may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, advertisements, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
<p>We may use Google AdSense advertising along with any other third-party advertising on the blog. Google is a third party that also uses cookies to serve ads on the blog for the purpose of providing a positive user experience.

<h3>California “Shine the Light” Act</h3>
<p>Pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light Act,” you are permitted to request information about the manner in which we share certain categories of information with third parties for their marketing use.
