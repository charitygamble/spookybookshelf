<div class="review-description">
<p><strong>The Honeys meets The Secret History in a work of dark academia like no other -- a boarding school thriller about a queer teen from Mississippi who finds himself swept into a world of old money, privilege, and the secret society at the heart of it all.</strong></p>

<p>When Cal Ware wins a scholarship to an elite New England boarding school, he's thrilled to leave his past behind. Back home in Mississippi, he was the poor, queer kid who never fit in. But at Essex Academy, he'll be able to reinvent himself. Or so he hopes...</p>

<p>But at Essex, Cal's classmates only see his cheap clothes and old iPhone. They mock his accent, and can't believe he's never left the country, or heard of The Hamptons. Cal, at his breaking point, is about to give up and return to Mississippi when he learns about a secret society on campus -- the key to becoming Essex royalty.</p>

<p>Cal knows he's not exactly secret society material, but to his surprise, he finds an unlikely champion in the handsome, charismatic, and slightly dangerous Luke Kim. As they get swept up in the mystery and glamour of the Rush process, Cal finds himself falling in love for the first time.</p>

<p>But as the initiation rituals grow riskier -- and increasingly nefarious -- Cal must decide how far he's willing to go, and how much of himself he's willing to sacrifice, to save everything and everyone he cherishes most. Because nothing at Essex -- not even Cal's first love -- is quite what it seems.</p>

<p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> Trauma from gay bashing incident (past), kidnapping, parental illness (cancer), instances of cutting and branding, physical abuse</p>

<div class="the_review">

<p>I love secret societies. Whenever I read a book set in a school, that is one of my biggest hopes - that there is some sort of secret society involved in the plot. Well, with <i>A Darker Mischief</i>, that hope is definitely fulfilled.</p>

<p>This book is definitely a slow-burn type of book. It will take a while to fully get into the story. It will also take a while to start understanding the characters presented <i>A Darker Mischief</i>. This is not one of those books where you get the characters' life story at the beginning. Even our main character, Cal, largely remains a mystery until later in the book. And if someone's story isn't important to the plot? Well, their story remains untold.</p>

<p>I have to say that I actually liked Luke more than I liked Cal. He seemed more genuine than Cal did. But Cal had his moments. Now for some reason, I'd suspected one of the secrets Cal held, but when it was revealed, I was still surprised. And no, I won't tell you what it is, you'll have to read the book to find out.</p>

<p>I loved the Society of Seven Eyes. For me, it is what made <i>A Darker Mischief</i> a four-star read. I loved the parties, the mystery, and the fact that the society's main "raison d'être" is to explore the grounds of Essex and dig up all of the history about the school. Including, perhaps, some secrets that pertain to Society.</p>

<p>The ending for <i>A Darker Mischief</i> was great. It perfectly closed out the book - and even left the book open for something of a sequel if perhaps a certain character wanted revenge on those who'd "wronged" him. I mean, the book ends perfectly as is, but a sequel could be fun as well.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of books that contain secret societies, I guarantee you'll want to read this book. Society of Seven Eyes features prominently in this story but so do the characters, which is important. I gave this one four-stars and hope to read more books from Derek Milman in the future.</p>
