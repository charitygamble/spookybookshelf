<p>Some day they'll write songs about me...From the outside, the Blind Rebels have it all. They are one of the most popular rock bands in the world. Their albums go platinum. Tickets to their concerts sell out in hours.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, they are a band hanging on by a thread.</p>

<p>Lead singer Mavrick Slater worries his guitarist and best friend is on a dangerous path to self-destruction.</p>

<p>Guitarist Callum Donogue is tired. Tied of being the one who cares. Tired of the constant touring. Drugs give him an escape.</p>

<p>Becka wants out of her dismal life in Chicago and to have songs written about her. The only way out she sees is on the arm of a rock star. Any rock star will do.</p>

<p>Find out the real story of what happened before the Blind Rebels series.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Also included in this book are several extra scenes from the Blind Rebels series.

<p>Blurring the Lines is a novella meant for adult audiences. Content includes strong language, explicit sexual scenes, cheating, mention of drug and alcohol use, mention of overdose leading to death, and other mature situations.</p>

<div class="the_review">
<p><i>Blurring the Lines + Extras</i> is a prequel novella with some extra tidbits for the Blind Rebels series, all wrapped into one tidy little package. This book does contain spoilers for the Blind Rebels series, so if spoilers bother you, I recommend either reading the series first or stopping after ,<i>Blurring the Lines</i> and waiting to read the extras until after you've finished the Blind Rebels series.</p>

<p>As a huge fan of the Blind Rebels series, I'd often wondered exactly how the events played out that led up to the Rebels' hiatus. I knew it had to do with Mavrick, Callum, and Mavrick's fiancee Becka, but I wasn't sure how it had all played out. Now I know.</p>

<p>I'm going to be honest, I dislike Becka even more now than I did before. While there were times I could relate to her, she really got under my skin most of the time. I had a hard time understanding what Mav saw in her to be honest.</p>

<p><i>Blurring the Lines</i> was very well written and relieves the itch of wanting to know what happened before the events of <i>Bridging the Silence</i> took place. Now... about those extras!</p>

<p>The extras are the parts that will be spoilers for the Blind Rebels series. Like I said above, if you want to avoid spoilers, I recommend reading the series first or just reading <i>Blurring the Lines</i> and leaving the extras until later. The extras include events from other perspectives, events that don't actually appear in the books, and in some cases, things that happened after the series was over. You'll get to see some beloved characters dealing with things in new ways or just dealing with new experiences.</p>

<p>I gave <i>Blurring the Lines + Extras</i> a solid five stars because it perfectly starts off the series and gives so much more to the series! I can't wait to read the next series.</p>
