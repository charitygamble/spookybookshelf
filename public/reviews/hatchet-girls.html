<p><strong>Set more than one hundred years after the Borden murders, this propulsive, supernatural thriller imagines what might happen if history were to repeat itself today. Perfect for fans of Kara Thomas and Courtney Summers!</strong></p>

<p>When Mariella Morse accuses her boyfriend, Vik Gomez, of murdering her wealthy parents with an axe, the town is quick to believe her. It doesn’t help that Vik is caught standing over her parents’ bodies with blood on his hands, unable to remember anything about the night in question.</p>

<p>But Vik’s sister, Tessa, knows that Vik would never be capable of such a gruesome crime. Haunted by the mistakes she made that led her family to move to Fall River, MA in the first place, she sets out to prove her brother’s innocence.</p>

<p>Tessa’s search for answers will lead her into a sprawling, notoriously cursed forest, where she and Mariella must face a darkness that has lurked within their town since before the days of Lizzie Borden—the original axe murderess of Fall River.</p>

<p><strong>Content Warning:</strong> Violence, mentions of murder, blood, grief, abuse</p>

<div class="the_review">

<p>I’m going to be honest – while I did enjoy <strong>Hatchet Girls</strong>, I’m not going to say it was my favorite read of 2023 by any means. The characters were good, some had more background than others, and in some cases, I think some of the characters could have used a bit more background.</p>

<p>The plot was pretty unique and I really enjoyed it, as well as the writing style in the book. Unfortunately, I guessed the “bad guy” way too early in the book and it kind of spoiled the book for me because of that. However, I did enjoy the way the book ends because it was pretty cool.</p>

<p>All in all, I gave the book 3 stars because to be perfectly honest, while it was a pretty good read and worked well for Spooky Season, it just wasn’t a favorite of mine.</p>
