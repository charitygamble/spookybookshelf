<p><strong>AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!</strong></p>

<p><strong>As alluring as it is unsettling, award-winning author CG Drews' debut YA psychological horror will leave readers breathless and hesitant to venture deeper into the woods.</strong></p>

<p><em>Once upon a time, Andrew had cut out his heart and given it to this boy, and he was very sure Thomas had no idea that Andrew would do anything for him. Protect him. Lie for him.</em></p>

<p><em>Kill for him.</em></p>

<p><em>High school senior Andrew Perrault finds refuge in the twisted fairytales that he writes for the only person who can ground him to reality—Thomas Rye, the boy with perpetually ink-stained hands and hair like autumn leaves. And with his twin sister, Dove, inexplicably keeping him at a cold distance upon their return to Wickwood Academy, Andrew finds himself leaning on his friend even more.</em></p>

<p><em>But something strange is going on with Thomas. His abusive parents have mysteriously vanished, and he arrives at school with blood on his sleeve. Thomas won't say a word about it, and shuts down whenever Andrew tries to ask him questions. Stranger still, Thomas is haunted by something, and he seems to have lost interest in his artwork—whimsically macabre sketches of the monsters from Andrew's wicked stories.</em></p>

<p><em>Desperate to figure out what's wrong with his friend, Andrew follows Thomas into the off-limits forest one night and catches him fighting a nightmarish monster—Thomas's drawings have come to life and are killing anyone close to him. To make sure no one else dies, the boys battle the monsters every night. But as their obsession with each other grows stronger, so do the monsters, and Andrew begins to fear that the only way to stop the creatures might be to destroy their creator...</em></p>

<div class="the_review">
<p>I’m amazed that I’ve managed to read multiple books in the past few days, but it happened. This time, I finally got off my butt and read <em>Don’t Let the Forest In</em> by CG Drews. I’ve been following CG Drews on Instagram for quite a while and when they announced that their debut YA Horror novel was on NetGalley, I jumped at the chance to request it. But then, after getting approved, my brain said “nope, no reading for you” and it sat in my Kindle app… until last night when I finally got off my butt and started reading. I’m glad I did.</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>

<p>The main characters, Andrew and Thomas, are quite interesting. Andrew is anxious about literally everything, while Thomas is tough and seen as a bad kid for the most part. At least that’s how everyone seems to view him. I liked both characters quite a bit.</p>

<p>Dove was so standoffish that I was taken aback – after all, she’s Andrew’s twin and even if she didn’t like Thomas for some reason, you wouldn’t think she’d abandon Andrew. But there’s a reason for it and I guessed that reason about halfway through the book.</p>

<p>As for the other characters, we see them but we don’t. We don’t get a lot of background on them and we don’t see them as much as Andrew and Thomas because the story isn’t about them. It’s about Andrew and Thomas.</p>

<p>All in all, I enjoyed the characters very much and enjoyed seeing asexuality portrayed as a lot of LGBTQ+ books I read don’t include asexuality.</p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

<p>I have to admit, I’ve never been a big fan of forests. Sure, they can be beautiful, but I always end up thinking of what could be lurking out there. So that makes the atmosphere of this story all the better. Let us not forget the boarding school – that seems determined to ignore the weirdness of what is going on – and you’ve got the perfect creepy atmosphere for a story. Especially when you realize the forest might not be staying on its side of the fence.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>CG Drews has a writing style may trip some readers up. The prose in this book, while not extremely difficult to read, is dark, twisted, and makes you stop and consider the imagery that is being put forth on the page. Some might be tempted to call the writing “flowery” for its descriptive nature, but it isn’t flowery – it is dark, moody, creepy, and full of rot and decay. And considering this is a horror novel, that’s a good thing. I have their next novel, <em>Hazelthorn</em>, in my NetGalley queue and I’m anxious to read it as well, as I want to continue reading this deliciously dark writing.</p>

<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>The plot for <em>Don’t Let the Forest In</em> might seem to take a bit to fully be understood, but it is meant to be that way. After all, there wouldn’t be a story if the plot was blatantly obvious from the start. No, this plot unfolds slowly, with twists coming here and there. The twists are rarely what you expect and even if you are expecting something, it may not be entirely correct. Some things become obvious as you read, others just pop up out of nowhere. It makes for a delightfully creepy read!</p>

<h2>Intrigue</h2>

<p>The intrigue in this book is amazing. There are so many questions that pop into your head as you read. Is Thomas what the gossip says he is? Why doesn’t Dove want anything to do with Thomas and why is she distancing herself from Andrew and everyone else? Does the school’s biggest bully have anything to do with this? What is going on here? Is all of this real? So many questions, so few answers…</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>The relationships in this book are beautifully broken. Dove seems to want nothing to do with her twin. Andrew and Thomas dance around what they are and how they feel for each other. Even the relationships between faculty and Andrew or faculty and Thomas are disjointed, out of place, slightly off-center. It makes for wonderful reading and even more questions!</p>

<h2>Ending</h2>

<p>The ending? Obviously meant to be a one-off book. Stand-alone. No need for another book. Yet the ending will also leave you staring at the wall, wondering if it really is over. What did you just read there at the very end? Is everything OK? Is everything not OK? Who lived? Who died? What is going on? Was this all just a fever-dream? And yet even with all the unanswered questions that may pop into your head, you realize… you don’t want a sequel. It is perfect as it is.</p>

<p>I gave this book 5 stars. Not because I’ve been following CG Drews since before this book was even put on NetGalley, but because this book was amazing. Deliciously creepy, twisty, nightmare fuel that may not keep you up for days, but might make you stare a little closer at the shadows… or the trees in your backyard.</p>
