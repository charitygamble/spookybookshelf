<div class="the_review">
<p><i>Blurring the Lines + Extras</i> is a prequel novella with some extra tidbits for the Blind Rebels series, all wrapped into one tidy little package. This book does contain spoilers for the Blind Rebels series, so if spoilers bother you, I recommend either reading the series first or stopping after ,<i>Blurring the Lines</i> and waiting to read the extras until after you've finished the Blind Rebels series.</p>

<p>As a huge fan of the Blind Rebels series, I'd often wondered exactly how the events played out that led up to the Rebels' hiatus. I knew it had to do with Mavrick, Callum, and Mavrick's fiancee Becka, but I wasn't sure how it had all played out. Now I know.</p>

<p>I'm going to be honest, I dislike Becka even more now than I did before. While there were times I could relate to her, she really got under my skin most of the time. I had a hard time understanding what Mav saw in her to be honest.</p>

<p><i>Blurring the Lines</i> was very well written and relieves the itch of wanting to know what happened before the events of <i>Bridging the Silence</i> took place. Now... about those extras!</p>

<p>The extras are the parts that will be spoilers for the Blind Rebels series. Like I said above, if you want to avoid spoilers, I recommend reading the series first or just reading <i>Blurring the Lines</i> and leaving the extras until later. The extras include events from other perspectives, events that don't actually appear in the books, and in some cases, things that happened after the series was over. You'll get to see some beloved characters dealing with things in new ways or just dealing with new experiences.</p>

<p>I gave <i>Blurring the Lines + Extras</i> a solid five stars because it perfectly starts off the series and gives so much more to the series! I can't wait to read the next series.</p>
