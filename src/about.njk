<h3>About the Site &#128128;</h3>
                    <section class="welcome about-me bottom-of-the-page">
                        <p>This site was originally created in 2015 or 2016 (I can't remember) and was a blog on Blogger, which then moved to self-hosted WordPress. I changed the name from The Spooky Bookshelf to Charli's Book Box a couple of years later, still on WordPress. Then I moved from Charli's Book Box to Cozy Books N Games, which I grew tired of pretty quickly. I also grew tired of WordPress pretty quickly, so I decided to put the site back on The Spooky Bookshelf and make it an indie web site!</p>
                        <p>Please note that I will be working to make the site as accessible as possible, so if you are having issues with the site, please check back later for updates on that front.</p>
